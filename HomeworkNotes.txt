Utilize the Bootstrap Starter Kit
Copy the Jumbotron example code from the Bootstrap Documentation site
Paste it into your index.html file in the appropriate location (hint: within .row)

I have gone and created the 2 custom files

- 1, custom.css that will get called after bootstrap.min.css
- 2, custom.js that will be called right before the closing (</body>) body element.

custom.css
- this will be where you will apply any custom css styles
custom.js
- where you will need to add the functionality of button clicks

+ Hint:
With jQuery, you can do multiple CSS property styles

e.g.

$('element').css({
   'font-size' : '10px',
   'width' : '30px',
   'height' : '10px'
});

The fade-in effect is using the animation features of CSS3,
transition: background 1s linear

+ Hint:
For this homework, i used "background-image" and "transition" in my jquery to do the background image swap and the fade-in effect.

There's a bug when you first click on any button, the background image doesn't fade in but succeeding ones do and that's fine for now.
